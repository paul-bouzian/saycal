  "faq_4_question": "How many voice events can I create per month?",
  "faq_4_answer": "With Premium (€5/month), voice creation is unlimited.",
  "faq_5_question": "Are my data secure?",

  "faq_8_question": "What if I just want the calendar without voice?",
  "faq_8_answer": "The free tier is for you. Full calendar, premium interface, unlimited events. Voice is a bonus, not a requirement.",

  "cta_body_primary": "SayCal is free. Sign-up takes 30 seconds. And your first voice event? 5 seconds.",
